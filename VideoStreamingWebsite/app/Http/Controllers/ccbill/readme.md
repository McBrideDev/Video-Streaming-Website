# CCBill Package

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MCProHosting/ccbill-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MCProHosting/ccbill-php)

This is a PHP package for interacting with the CCBill API. Currently this library only supports a subset of features, but it may expand in the future.

See the "examples" folder for usage demonstrations.

# CCBill WHMCS Gateway

We also include a gateway for use with WHMCS in the "whmcs" directory of this repository. It enables non-recurring payments via the the [dynamic pricing](https://www.ccbill.com/cs/manuals/CCBill_Dynamic_Pricing.pdf) functionality of CCBill.
